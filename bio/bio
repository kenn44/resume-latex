I'm Kenneth Assogba, currently studying Master in Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing with a proven track record of designing and shipping high-value software solutions.

I'm passionate about technology, always looking to test new stuff such as programming language, library, smartphone, app, ... I really enjoy discovering new things that can improve my understanding of the world.
In this optic, I have a lot of opinion on a lot of things and I don't hesitate (like ?) to argue on propositions or ideas.

During my formation I have principally learnt through practice which result in some interesting projects that you can find on my github : https://github.com/kenn44
I had some experiences in great companies like Etrilabs (etrilabs.com), Solutis (solutis-it.com) and a lot of experience linked to Education as teacher, where I had the chance to really learn the meaning of transmitting your knowledge to different kind of people.

On all my experimentation and projects on software or modeling, with different kind of technology like Python, C++ and JavaScript, I have acquired a good understanding of the technological world we live in.

Voluntary, curious and determined, I'm a french-austrian student fond of space engineering. My current objective is to link my passion with my future profesionnal life as a researcher in space robotics.
